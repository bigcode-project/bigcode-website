Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming an essential tool for all fields of AI research. These large, powerful models—-also known as foundation models—-can be adapted to a wide variety of language tasks with little domain-specific data. However, it is increasingly difficult for academia and smaller industry labs to develop such models due to their high training cost and large engineering efforts. To democratize the training of LLMs, the [Big Science collaboration](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) was launched in 2021 and their year-long program successfully ended with the release of the [World’s Largest Open Multilingual Language Model](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom). 

Building on this success, we introduce Big Code: an open-scientific collaboration focused on LLMs for code. The purpose of the Big Code initiative is to collaboratively work towards developing and releasing LLMs for code. To this end, the collaboration [actively seeks contributions from AI practitioners](/docs/about/join) who are interested in the following research topics:
- Curating training datasets for code LLMs
- Distributed training methods for LLMs
- Developing a representative evaluation suite for code LLMs (i.e., covering multiple tasks and programming languages)
- Developing methods for faster training and inference of LLMs
- Discussing the legal aspects of Code LLMs
