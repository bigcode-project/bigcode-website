Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming an essential tool for all fields of AI research. One striking feature of these large pre-trained models is that they can be adapted to a wide variety of language tasks, often with very little in-domain data. 

BigCode is focused on developing state-of-the-art LLMs for code. Code LLMs enable the completion and synthesis of code, both from other code snippets and natural language descriptions, and work across a wide range of domains, tasks, and programming languages. These models can, for example, assist professional and citizen developers with coding new applications.  

BigCode [invites AI researchers]({{< relref "docs/about/join.md" >}}) to collaborate on the following topics:
- A representative evaluation suite for code LLMs, covering a diverse set of tasks and programming languages
- Responsible data governance and development for code LLMs
- Faster training and inference methods for LLMs

The project is inspired by [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), an open scientific collaboration which culminated in July 2022 with the release of the [World’s Largest Open Multilingual Language Model](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom). BigCode aims to follow, as well as establish, new responsible AI practices to train and share large language models. We welcome contributions from AI researchers and strive for openness and transparency in the LLM development process. To foster open collaboration across institutes and corporations, we've established a legal framework for the project. See [how we manage intellectual property]({{< relref "docs/about/ip.md" >}}). 



<!-- However, it is increasingly difficult for academia and smaller industry labs to develop such models due to their high training cost and large engineering efforts. To democratize the training of LLMs, the [Big Science project](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) was launched in May 2021 and their year-long program culminated with the release of the [World’s Largest Open Multilingual Language Model](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom). 

Building on this success, we introduce Big Code: an open-scientific collaboration focused on LLMs for code. The purpose of the Big Code project is to collaboratively work towards exploring, training, releasing LLMs for code. To this end, the collaboration [actively seeks contributions from AI practitioners](/docs/about/join) who are interested in the following research topics:
- Curating training datasets for code LLMs
- Distributed training methods for LLMs
- Developing a representative evaluation suite for code LLMs (i.e., covering multiple tasks and programming languages)
- Developing methods for faster training and inference of LLMs
- Discussing the legal aspects of Code LLMs -->
