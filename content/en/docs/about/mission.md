Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming an essential tool for all fields of AI research. These large, general-purpose models—-also known as foundation models—can be adapted to a wide variety of language tasks with very little domain-specific data. However, developing such models is becoming increasingly challenging for academia, non-profits, and smaller industry labs because of their high training costs and large engineering efforts. In 2021, the [Big Science collaboration](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) was launched to democratise the training of such LLMs and their year-long program successfully ended with the release of [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom), the World’s Largest Open Multilingual Language Model. 

Building on the success of Big Science, we introduce Big Code, an open-scientific collaboration working on LLMs for code. We
