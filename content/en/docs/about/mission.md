Large language models (LLMs) are fast becoming an essential tool for all field of AI research. These large, general-purpose models—-also known as foundation models—can be adapted to a wide variety of language tasks with very little domain-specific data. However, developing such models is becoming increasingly challenging for academia, non-profits, and smaller industry labs because of their high training costs and large engineering efforts. In 2021, the Big Science initiative was launched to democratise the training of such LLMs and their year-long program successfully finished in July 2022 with the release of BLOOM, the largest open multi-lingual language model. 

Inspired by the success of Big Science, we introduce Big Code, an open-scientific collaboration working on LLMs for code. We share similar
