## Sponsors
Big Code is led by [ServiceNow Research](https://servicenow.com/research) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co). Both organizations commit research and engineering time to ensure that the collaboration runs smoothly and makes progress towards the pre-set goals. ServiceNow Research also makes their compute cluster available for large-scale training. 

## Members
While Big Code aims to be as inclusive as possible, we acknowledge that small groups of focused contributors often make faster progress. For this reason, the organisation is comprised of **core members** and **contributors**. Core members are dedicating a significant portion of their working time to the Big Code project whereas contributors either advise on specific aspects of the project or take on smaller tasks. Although Big Code strives for open communication, we Core members can setup private channels to facilitate faster communication on the tasks they are working on. 

## Operations
We run the Big Code project through the following tools and platforms:
- We actively manage the project through a Github project board
- We use slack for all internal communication
- We train models with Megatron-LM 
- We host all code repositories on Github
- We host all model weights and datasets on HuggingFace

## Bi-yearly goals
Big Code runs on a bi-yearly cadence. Each half year, the core members discuss and set milestones for the next six months of work. You can find the objectives for the first iteration here.
