## Sponsors
BigCode is led by [ServiceNow Research](https://servicenow.com/research) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co). Both organizations commit research and engineering time to ensure that the collaboration runs smoothly and makes progress towards the pre-set goals. ServiceNow Research also makes their compute cluster available for large-scale training. 

## Members
We will shortly provide more details on the governance structure of the project. For now, the organization is led by **core members** of ServiceNow and HuggingFace while we are onboarding **contributors**. Core members dedicate a significant portion of their working time to the BigCode project whereas contributors advise on specific aspects of the project or take on smaller tasks. 

## Operations
We run the BigCode project through the following tools and platforms:
- We actively manage the project through a [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/bigcode-project/projects/1/)
- We use [Slack](https://bigcode-workspace.slack.com) for all internal communication (apply [here](https://forms.gle/Het4wd5WNoupBJHJA) to join!)
- We train models with a clone of [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM)
- We host all code repositories on [Github](https://github.com/bigcode-project)
- We host all model weights and datasets on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BigCode)

<!-- ## Bi-yearly goals
Big Code runs on a bi-yearly cadence. Each half year, the core members discuss and set milestones for the next six months of work. You can find the objectives for the first iteration here.  -->
