Contributions to BigCode are carried under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The Apache 2.0 license is the most commonly used open source license due to its permissive character and clarity regarding copyright and patents. Please take a look at the license before submitting any contributions! More specifically, please have a look at the definition of “Contribution” and Clause 5 “Submission of Contributions”. We believe the soul of BigCode to be clear and transparent communication striving towards open collaboration. 

## Contributions under a different license
In case you do not feel comfortable licensing some of your contributions to the project under the Apache 2.0, please let us know explicitly. We will see how to work around and make everyone comfortable. Note that for contributions with a non-permissive license, our general policy is to put them in a separate Github repository living outside the Big Code organisation.

## Balance with stakeholders' own interest
We are flexible and understand that each individual contributor or contributing party might have its own interests besides the collective Big Code effort. In case a stakeholder decides to change its licensing policy moving forward, our expectations are that previously submitted contributions remain available under a permissive license. 

## No CLA
Unlike open-source projects such as [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), Big Code does not make use of a [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html) (CLA). We believe the main role of a CLA is to centralize the IP licensing management under a single legal entity (e.g. Meta and Google for PyTorch and TensorFlow, respectively). Since Big Code is not a legal entity, the project does not use a CLA. This means that if, for example, Big Code wants to change the license of the project, we will need to reach consensus among all contributors.
