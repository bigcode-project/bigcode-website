Contributions to BigCode are carried under an Apache 2.0 license :scales: The Apache 2.0 license is the most commonly used open source license due to its permissive character and clarity regarding copyright and patents :hugging_face:

:bangbang:Please take a look at the license before submitting any contributions! More specifically, please have a look at the definition of “Contribution” and Clause 5 “Submission of Contributions”. We believe the soul of BigCode to be clear and transparent communication striving towards open collaboration:raised_hands: Thus, in case you do not feel comfortable licensing some of your contributions to the project under the Apache 2.0, please make it explicit to BigCode folks! We will see how to work around and make everyone comfortable :+1:

We are flexible and understand that each contributor in this project might have its own interests besides the collective BigCode effort and we are committed to strike a balance between BigCode’s collaborative efforts and stakeholders’ own interests aside the project, this is why clear communication is key in these instances :100: Any questions you may have, please reach us out: CONTACT INFO
