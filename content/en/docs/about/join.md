We are excited to invite AI practitioners from diverse backgrounds to join Big Code. Big Code is a *research* collaboration and we therefore expect participants to have a professional AI background and to commit some of their time to the project. For example, we believe that the following backgrounds are a good fit for the project..

- You are a master or PhD student working on text2code applications  
- You are a research scientist or engineer at a industry lab and working on the technical/ethical/legal aspects of large language models

.. but we are open to all applications. [Please fill the form here!](TODO)
