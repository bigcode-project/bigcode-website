We are excited to invite AI practitioners from diverse backgrounds to join the BigCode project! Note that BigCode is a *research collaboration* and is open to participants who 
1. have a professional research background and 
2. are able to commit time to the project.  

In general, we expect applicants to be affiliated with a research organization (either in academia or industry) and work on the technical/ethical/legal aspects of LLMs for coding applications. 

You can [apply here](https://forms.gle/Het4wd5WNoupBJHJA) to the BigCode project!
