We are excited to invite AI practitioners from diverse backgrounds to join the Big Code project! Note that Big Code is a *research collaboration* and is open to participants who 
1. have a professional research background and 
2. are able to commit time to the project.  

In general, we expect applicants to be affiliated with a research organization (either in academia or industry) and work on the technical/ethical/legal aspects of LLMs for coding applications. 

You can apply to the Big Code project [here!](https://forms.gle/Het4wd5WNoupBJHJA)
