We are releasing the first set of BigCode models, which are going to be licensed under the CodeML OpenRAIL-M 0.1 license, as we initially stated here and in our membership form. The CodeML OpenRAIL-M 0.1 is an interim version of the license that is being drafted for the release of BigCode in March 2023. This license is an open and responsible AI license (OpenRAIL). 

# What is an OpenRAIL license?
Open Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are licenses designed to permit free and open access, re-use, and downstream distribution of derivatives of AI artifacts, for research, commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as the use restrictions present in the license always apply (including to derivative works). For more information, please access the RAIL Initiative post.
